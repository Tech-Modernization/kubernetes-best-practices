# kubernetes-best-practices

 Application teams are undergoing Cloud transformation moving to a containerized environment powered by Kubernetes. 
The container technology choice is Docker. Docker is currently the de facto standard in the industry for containers. 
ocker allows for applications to build, ship and run anywhere on any platform. The rise of container use has increased 
the need for orchestration of those containers. The leader in container orchestration is Kubernetes. An open source 
project from Google that decouples containers from infrastructure. This paper correlates best practices from leaders 
in the industry such as Google and Redhat, as well as Contino’s experience in the field. It is intended to serve as a 
starting point for teams to help them on their Cloud journey into using Kubernetes. It also will raise awareness to 
remediate, optimize and operationalize Application Development in a Kubernetes environment.
